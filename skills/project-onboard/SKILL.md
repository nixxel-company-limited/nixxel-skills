  Onboard an AI agent into any project — detect stack (web, mobile, backend),
  research up-to-date docs, run a universal 8-category audit (pages, state, UI,
  API, data, auth, jobs, integrations) with auto-detection and auto-skip,
  interview the developer, and generate structured context files with task-based
  routing so the agent never wastes time exploring the project again. Use this
  skill whenever the user says "onboard", "set up context", "scan this project",
  "generate CLAUDE.md", "map this codebase", "audit features", "what does this
  project do", or any request to help an AI agent understand a new or existing
  codebase. Also trigger when the user starts working in an unfamiliar repo and
  would benefit from structured context generation.

# Project Onboard

A skill that onboards AI agents into any project by generating structured,
task-routed context files. Unlike `/init` which produces a flat CLAUDE.md,
this skill creates a progressive disclosure system where the agent reads
only what it needs for the current task — saving tokens and eliminating
redundant project exploration.

## Invocation

```
/onboard                     Full onboard (all phases)
/onboard --quick             Phase 1+2 only (skip audit & interview)
/onboard Thai                Full onboard, confirm output language first
/onboard-update              Incremental update (changed files only)
/onboard-update --full       Re-scan everything, keep interview answers
/onboard-audit               Run feature audit only (Phase 3)
/onboard-audit --update      Update audit for changed files only
/onboard-suggest             Suggest skills for detected stack
```

## Language Support

If the user appends a language name to the command (e.g., `/onboard Thai`,
`/onboard Japanese`), confirm the language before proceeding:

```
"You requested output in Thai. This will generate all context files
and CLAUDE.md in Thai. Confirm? (yes/no)"
```

If confirmed, write ALL output files in that language — CLAUDE.md, context
files, feature map, everything. The SKILL.md instructions themselves remain
in English, but generated output respects the user's language choice.

Default language is English if not specified.

## How It Works

The skill runs 4 phases. Each phase builds on the previous one.
The agent knows more at each step, so later phases are smarter.

```
Phase 1: DISCOVER .......... auto-detect stack + research docs
Phase 2: GENERATE .......... create CLAUDE.md + context files
Phase 3: FEATURE AUDIT ..... map Page → API → DB → Feature (optional)
Phase 4: INTERVIEW ......... ask the developer (knows everything now)
```

Phase 3 and 4 are optional. After Phase 2, ask the user:
- "Want me to audit existing features? (maps pages, endpoints, DB)"
- "Want me to interview you for business context?"

If the user runs `/onboard --quick`, skip Phase 3 and 4.

---

## Phase 1: DISCOVER

Two sub-phases. Do not ask the user anything during this phase.

### Phase 1a: DETECT

Read project files to identify the tech stack and tooling.
Do NOT use `find` or `ls` recursively. Read specific known files only.

Check these files (skip if they don't exist):

**Package managers & stack:**
- `package.json` → Node.js ecosystem, framework, dependencies, scripts
- `pubspec.yaml` → Flutter/Dart
- `go.mod` → Go
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `Pipfile` → Python
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `composer.json` → PHP
- `Gemfile` → Ruby

**Mobile:**
- `package.json` dep `react-native` → React Native
- `app.json` / `app.config.js` → Expo
- `pubspec.yaml` dep `flutter` → Flutter

**State management:**
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` / `zustand` / `jotai` / `@tanstack/react-query` in deps
- `riverpod` / `bloc` / `provider` in pubspec.yaml

**Background jobs:**
- `bullmq` / `bull` / `celery` / `sidekiq` in deps
- Queue processor files

**i18n:**
- Locale files (`en.json`, `th.json`, etc.)
- i18n library in deps (`next-intl`, `react-i18next`, `flutter_localizations`)

**Configuration:**
- `tsconfig.json` → TypeScript settings
- `.eslintrc*` / `biome.json` / `.prettierrc` → linting/formatting
- `docker-compose.yml` / `Dockerfile` → containerization
- `vercel.json` / `netlify.toml` / `fly.toml` → deploy target
- `.env.example` → environment variables (NEVER read .env)

**Database:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` → Prisma schema
- `drizzle.config.ts` → Drizzle ORM
- `knexfile.*` / `ormconfig.*` → other ORMs
- `migrations/` or `db/migrate/` → check migration tool

**CI/CD & workflows:**
- `.github/workflows/` → GitHub Actions
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` → GitLab CI
- `.husky/` → git hooks

**Testing:**
- `jest.config*` / `vitest.config*` / `playwright.config*` / `cypress.config*`
- Count test files: how many `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*` files exist

**Existing AI context:**
- `CLAUDE.md` → preserve, merge later
- `.cursor/rules/` → import conventions
- `AGENTS.md` → existing agent instructions
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` → existing copilot rules

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` → project description, setup
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` → team conventions
- `CHANGELOG.md` → recent changes, current version
- `docs/` → architecture docs

### Phase 1b: RESEARCH

Use the information from Phase 1a to do targeted research.

**1. Project docs — read what exists in the repo**

Read README.md fully. Extract: project purpose, setup instructions,
architecture notes. If CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/ exist, read those too.

**2. Stack docs — pull up-to-date docs via Context7 (conditional)**

Read `.claude/onboard-meta.json` if it exists. For each major dependency:

- If version has changed since last onboard → pull fresh docs
- If docs are older than 7 days → pull fresh docs
- If docs are fresh and version unchanged → SKIP, use cached

When pulling, query Context7 for the specific version detected.
Focus on: conventions, breaking changes, migration guides, best practices.

Save results to `.claude/context/stack-docs/{lib}-{version}.md`

**3. Skills — search for relevant skills**

Based on detected stack, search for available skills:
- `npx skills search {framework}` if the CLI is available
- Or note recommendations from known sources:
  - `vercel-labs/agent-skills` (React, Next.js, deploy)
  - `VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills` (community collection)

Store recommendations for Phase 2 output and Phase 4 suggestion.

**4. Ecosystem — verify actual tooling**

Read `package.json` scripts to understand real build/test/dev commands.
Read CI config to understand actual pipeline steps.
Read tsconfig/eslint to understand actual code conventions.
DO NOT assume — verify from config files.

---

## Phase 2: GENERATE

Generate the output files. Read `references/output-format.md` for the
complete templates and file structure.

### Output structure

```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md                          # ≤ 150 lines, task-routed
└── .claude/
    ├── context/
    │   ├── architecture.md            # Directory map + patterns
    │   ├── conventions.md             # Coding standards (from config)
    │   ├── workflow.md                # CI/CD, deploy, branch strategy
    │   ├── stack-docs/               # Cached library docs
    │   │   └── {lib}-{version}.md
    │   └── warnings.md               # Things to watch out for
    ├── commands/
    │   ├── onboard-update.md          # /onboard-update command
    │   └── onboard-audit.md           # /onboard-audit command
    ├── onboard-meta.json              # Metadata for incremental updates
    └── .claudeignore                  # (if not exists) auto-generated
```

### CLAUDE.md — CRITICAL RULES

CLAUDE.md is NOT documentation for humans. It is a decision tree for the AI agent.

Write it using the **task-based routing** pattern:

```
BEFORE [action] → read [file]
WHEN [situation] → read [file]
```

Never just list files. Always tell the agent WHEN to read each file.

Read `references/output-format.md` for the full CLAUDE.md template.

### Context files — AI-first writing

Every context file must start with:
1. WHEN to read this file (one line)
2. HOW the agent should use the information
3. The actual content — concise, structured, actionable

Do NOT write prose. Write structured data the agent can act on.

### onboard-meta.json

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "last_onboard": "ISO-8601",
  "last_update": "ISO-8601",
  "git_commit": "hash",
  "language": "en",
  "stack": ["nextjs", "prisma", "postgresql"],
  "platforms": {
    "web": true,
    "mobile": false,
    "backend": true
  },
  "categories_detected": [
    "pages-routing",
    "api-middleware",
    "data-layer",
    "auth-security",
    "background-events",
    "integrations-infra"
  ],
  "stack_docs": {
    "next": { "version": "15.1.0", "docs_pulled_at": "ISO-8601" }
  },
  "phases_completed": ["discover", "generate"],
  "interview_done": false,
  "audit_done": false
}
```

### Merging with existing CLAUDE.md

If CLAUDE.md already exists:
1. Read it fully
2. Preserve all existing content
3. ADD missing sections (task routing, context references, warnings)
4. DO NOT overwrite user-written content
5. Mark generated sections with `<!-- generated by project-onboard -->`

### Skill recommendations

After generating files, show the user what skills are available:

```
"Detected: Next.js + React + Prisma. Recommended skills:"
  1. vercel-react-best-practices — 40+ React performance rules
  2. web-design-guidelines — accessibility + UX audit
  
"Install with: npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices"
"Want me to install any of these?"
```

---

## Phase 3: UNIVERSAL AUDIT (optional)

Ask before running: "Want me to audit existing features? I'll scan
pages, state, UI, API, data, auth, jobs, and integrations."

If yes, scan the codebase using 8 categories. Each category auto-detects
and auto-skips if not found. Read `references/universal-audit.md` for
full scanning strategies and output templates.

### The 8 Categories

| # | Category | Output file | What it covers |
|---|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Pages & Routing | `pages-routing.md` | Pages, screens, navigation, deep links, route guards |
| 2 | State & Data Fetching | `state-data.md` | Stores, slices, providers, client caching, data fetching |
| 3 | Design System & UI | `design-system.md` | Components, theming, forms, i18n, accessibility |
| 4 | API & Middleware | `api-middleware.md` | Endpoints, middleware pipeline, validation, error handling |
| 5 | Data Layer | `data-layer.md` | DB schema, migrations, caching, transactions, seeds |
| 6 | Auth & Security | `auth-security.md` | Authentication, authorization, rate limits, CORS, secrets |
| 7 | Background & Events | `background-events.md` | Jobs, event-driven arch, scheduled tasks, service comms |
| 8 | Integrations & Infra | `integrations-infra.md` | External APIs, file storage, logging, config, health checks |

Cross-reference all detected categories into `_feature-map.md`.
Also identify orphans: unmapped endpoints, pages, state, jobs, DB tables.

### Output files

```
.claude/context/features/
  ├── _feature-map.md           # Cross-reference all categories per feature
  ├── pages-routing.md          # 1: Pages & Routing (web + mobile)
  ├── state-data.md             # 2: State & Data Fetching
  ├── design-system.md          # 3: Design System & UI
  ├── api-middleware.md          # 4: API & Middleware
  ├── data-layer.md             # 5: Data Layer
  ├── auth-security.md          # 6: Auth & Security
  ├── background-events.md      # 7: Background & Events
  ├── integrations-infra.md     # 8: Integrations & Infra
  └── audit-meta.json           # Coverage stats per category
```

After generating, update CLAUDE.md with task-routing rules:

```
BEFORE modifying or creating any page, screen, or route:
  → read .claude/context/features/pages-routing.md
  → read .claude/context/features/_feature-map.md

BEFORE modifying app state (stores/slices/providers):
  → read .claude/context/features/state-data.md
  → read .claude/context/features/pages-routing.md (check consumers)

BEFORE modifying UI components, theming, forms, or i18n:
  → read .claude/context/features/design-system.md

BEFORE modifying or creating any API endpoint:
  → read .claude/context/features/api-middleware.md
  → read .claude/context/features/pages-routing.md (check callers)

BEFORE modifying database schema, caching, or migrations:
  → read .claude/context/features/data-layer.md
  → read .claude/context/features/_feature-map.md (check impact)

BEFORE modifying auth, permissions, or security config:
  → read .claude/context/features/auth-security.md

BEFORE modifying background jobs, events, or service communication:
  → read .claude/context/features/background-events.md

BEFORE modifying external integrations, logging, or config:
  → read .claude/context/features/integrations-infra.md
```

---

## Phase 4: INTERVIEW (optional)

The agent has now scanned and understood the entire project.
Questions are informed by everything discovered in Phase 1-3.

Ask before running: "Want me to ask you some questions about
the project? This helps me understand things code can't tell me."

### If Phase 3 was completed — short interview (3 questions)

The agent already knows the codebase deeply. Ask only what code cannot reveal:

```
1. "[Summary from README + code]. Is this accurate?
    Any business context or domain terms I should know?"

2. "Any conventions, processes, or areas I should NOT touch
    without asking first?"

3. "Anything else you want me to know?"
```

### If Phase 3 was skipped — full interview (4 groups)

#### Group 1: Business & Domain
```
1. "What does this project do? Who are the main users?"
2. "Any domain-specific terms I should understand?"
3. "What phase is this project in?
    (MVP / active dev / maintenance / legacy refactor)"
```

#### Group 2: Team & Workflow
```
4. "How many people work on this? Code review process?"
5. "Branch strategy? (trunk-based / gitflow / feature branches)"
6. "Deploy process? (auto/manual, staging environment?)"
7. "Any conventions you want me to always follow?"
```

#### Group 3: Code Quality & Testing
```
8. "Want to restructure the code?
    (e.g., extract business logic to service layer)"
    — If Phase 1 found logic in route handlers, mention it specifically.

9. "Do you want TDD? (write tests before implementation)"

10. "Testing strategy?"
    — Unit only
    — Unit + Integration
    — Unit + Integration + E2E
    — No tests yet, want to start

11. "Test framework preference?"
    — Mention what was detected: "Found [vitest/jest], correct?"
    — For E2E: Playwright / Cypress / other?

12. "Coverage target? (none / 60% / 80% / 90%+)"
    — If tests exist, mention current estimated coverage.
```

#### Group 4: AI Behavior
```
13. "Anything that AI agents frequently break in this project?"

14. "Files or folders I should never modify without asking?"

15. "How autonomous should I be?"
    — Conservative: always ask before acting
    — Balanced: act but explain
    — Autonomous: just do it

16. "Anything else I should know?"
```

### Adaptive questions

Questions MUST adapt to what was discovered. Do not ask generic questions
when you already have the answer from Phase 1-3.

**Example — tests detected:**
```
BAD:  "Do you want to write tests?"
GOOD: "Found Vitest with 23 test files, ~45% coverage.
       Want me to help increase coverage? Add E2E with Playwright?"
```

**Example — logic in route handlers:**
```
BAD:  "Want to restructure the code?"
GOOD: "Found business logic directly in route handlers
       (e.g., /api/pipelines has 120 lines of logic).
       Want me to extract it to a service layer?"
```

### Interview output

Save answers to context files:
- Business context → `.claude/context/business.md`
- Testing strategy → `.claude/context/testing-strategy.md`
- Update `warnings.md` with files/areas to protect
- Update `workflow.md` with team process info
- Update `conventions.md` with stated preferences
- Update CLAUDE.md task-routing with new sections

Update `onboard-meta.json`: set `interview_done: true`.

---

## Incremental Update (/onboard-update)

When the user runs `/onboard-update`:

1. Read `.claude/onboard-meta.json`
2. Run `git diff {last_commit}..HEAD --name-only` to find changed files
3. For each changed file, determine which context files need updating:
   - `package.json` changed → re-detect stack, check if docs need refresh
   - `prisma/schema.prisma` changed → update db-schema.md + feature-map
   - Route files changed → update api-endpoints.md + feature-map
   - Page files changed → update pages-views.md + feature-map
   - Config files changed → update conventions.md or workflow.md
4. Update only affected context files
5. Update `onboard-meta.json` with new timestamp and commit hash
6. Show summary: "Updated X files based on Y changes since last onboard"

For `/onboard-update --full`:
- Re-scan everything from Phase 1
- Regenerate all context files
- Preserve interview answers (do not re-ask)

---

## Stack Docs Caching

Context7 docs are cached in `.claude/context/stack-docs/`.
Pull strategy:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Never pulled | Pull now |
| Library version changed | Pull now (may have breaking changes) |
| Same version, docs ≤ 7 days old | Skip, use cache |
| Same version, docs > 7 days old | Pull fresh |
| User runs `--force-docs` | Pull everything |

---

## Future: Multi-agent Support

This skill currently generates output for Claude Code only.
Future versions may support additional agents:

```
Claude Code  → CLAUDE.md + .claude/context/
Cursor       → .cursor/rules/
Codex        → AGENTS.md
Copilot      → .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

The context files in `.claude/context/` are written in
agent-neutral markdown. Adding support for other agents
means generating a wrapper file that routes to the same context.

---

## Reference files

Read these before generating output:
- `references/output-format.md` — CLAUDE.md template, context file templates
- `references/feature-audit-format.md` — Feature audit output templates
- `references/universal-audit.md` — Full scanning strategies + output templates for all 8 audit categories
